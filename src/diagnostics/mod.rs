//! Flight diagnostics: an always-on watchdog, and an opt-in per-tick recorder.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Two of the three worst bugs in Phase 1 were invisible at the resolution anybody was
//! looking at. A stationary rocket on the launch pad was bouncing at 9.5 m/s and loading its
//! joints to nine times their breaking strength — for a third of a second, then it settled,
//! and every log line sampled at 0.5 s intervals showed a vessel sitting perfectly still.
//! SAS spun a motionless vessel up to 0.68 rad/s and reversed it every two seconds, which
//! looked like a constant number in any summary and like nothing at all on screen.
//!
//! Both were found by hand-writing a throwaway per-tick logger, twice. This is that logger,
//! made permanent, plus the checks that would have shouted about each bug without anyone
//! having to suspect it first.
//!
//! # Using it
//!
//! ```text
//! KRAKEN_TRACE=2 cargo run     # one line per physics tick for the first 2 seconds
//! KRAKEN_TRACE=all cargo run   # every tick, forever
//! ```
//!
//! The watchdog needs no flag. It is a handful of comparisons per tick and it is the reason
//! the next bug of this shape gets noticed on the run that introduces it.
