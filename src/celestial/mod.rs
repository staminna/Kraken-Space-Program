//! Celestial bodies: their gravity, and their atmospheres.
//!
//! Phase 1 is one body and one atmosphere, both resources with hardcoded stock values.
//! Phase 2 loads them from Lua and they become components on body entities — see
//! `sdk/api/planets.rs` in DESIGN.md's module plan. Nothing outside this module reads the
//! numbers directly; everything goes through [`body::CelestialBody`] and
//! [`atmosphere::Atmosphere`], so that change stays contained.
