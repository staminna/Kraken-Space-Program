//! The Kraken SDK — Lua definitions in, engine data out.
//!
//! # Scope right now
//!
//! Loading declarative *definitions* (parts today, celestial bodies later). Scripted
//! runtime behaviour — the part of the SDK that runs Lua every tick — is Phase 2, and the
//! tick-budget machinery in [`sandbox`] is already here waiting for it.
//!
//! # Dependency rule (design.md)
//!
//! `sdk/` talks to the rest of the engine only through ECS resources and events. It never
//! calls into `physics/`, `vessel/` or `rendering/`. The loader produces a
//! [`PartRegistry`](loader::PartRegistry); `vessel::assembly` consumes it. Neither knows
//! the other exists.
