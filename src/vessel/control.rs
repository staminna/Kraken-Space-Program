//! Player input → vessel control state → attitude torque.
//!
//! # Why input is sampled per frame but consumed per tick
//!
//! Keyboard state is read in `Update`, once per rendered frame, and stored on
//! [`ControlState`]. The physics systems read that stored value in `FixedUpdate` at 50 Hz.
//!
//! The alternative — reading the keyboard inside `FixedUpdate` — looks simpler and is
//! wrong: `just_pressed` is computed per frame, so on a 144 Hz display a tap that starts
//! and ends between two ticks would never be seen at all. Latching in `Update` means every
//! input reaches the simulation exactly once.
